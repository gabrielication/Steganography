# StegApp

StegApp is a open source university project created with the goal of implementing parallel programming techniques in order to develop an application -currently in BETA- able to hide texts inside images. StegApp uses a technique called "Steganography" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and it's implemented by RenderScript, Google's framework for cpu-intensive tasks. Steganography IS NOT encryption but a simple concealment. For further information visit GitHub (https://github.com/gabrielication/Steganography).
